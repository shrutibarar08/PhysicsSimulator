# Physics Simulation Project

![Project Preview](img/scene.png)


This repository contains a physics simulation framework split into three main components:

1. **Google Testing Framework** - A unit testing framework to verify the correctness of the physics simulation.
2. **Simulation Sandbox** - A real-time simulation environment for visualizing and testing physics interactions.
3. **Physics Static Library** *(Ongoing Development)* - A reusable physics engine library providing core physics computations and utilities.

## Project Structure

### 1. Google Testing Framework
- Implements unit tests for validating core physics functionalities.
- Ensures correctness and stability of physics computations.
- Uses Google Test for automated testing.

### 2. Simulation Sandbox
- A real-time physics simulation environment.
- Implements various physics interactions such as object motion, collisions, and forces.
- Provides UI tools via ImGUI for debugging and visualization.
- Supports:
  - Rendering of basic primitives (cubes, spheres, etc.)
  - Texture mapping and lighting system
  - Dynamic object creation
  - Scenario-based simulations
  - JSON-based scenario loading and state management
  
### 3. Physics Static Library *(Ongoing Development)*
- Will provide core physics calculations and utilities.
- Designed for reusability across different projects.
- Planned features:
  - Collision detection algorithms
  - Rigid body dynamics
  - Mathematical utilities for physics calculations
