# Project TODO List

1. Create some kind of Architecture that will hold
   GUI for colliders and Particles Since creating GUI for different types
   of effects and colliders arent possible to abstract into 1 way only.
	
	i> Also Needed to update registry since I dont wanna create physics materials
	   directly from physics library (need more control!);

2. Add IEntity as a parent for physicsObject since I need to draw colliders
   border so that I can visualize it!

3. Implement Save and Load from Json a little dynamically right now
   everything is dumped on objectmanager (looks really bad!);
